			<h1>Rediscovering boolean algebra</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
					(Introduction)
					I wanted to find a way to get an output out of a logical circuit by merely plugging in values into a mathematical formula.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>First steps</h2>
				<p>
					First of all, I denoted all of the outputs of gates or functions with Latin letters and all of the inputs to gates and functions with Greek letters.
					This is merely a convention to follow.
					Inputs to functions $\alpha, \beta, \dots$ should be either 0 or 1, and the outputs $a, b, \dots$ should also be either 0 or 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will denote the AND gate as $\wedge$, the OR gate as $\vee$, the XOR gate as $\oplus$ and the NEG gate as $\neg$.
				</p>
				<h3>Defining the gates</h3>
				<p>
					To begin, I tried to define the basic NOT, AND and OR gates.
					The NOT gate can be succintly expressed as $\neg\kappa = 1 - \kappa$ (since $\kappa$ will only ever be 0 or 1), and the AND gate already comes built into algebra in the form of multiplication: $\alpha \wedge \beta = \alpha\beta$, since our values are 0 and 1, so the only way for this function to output 1 is if both values are 1.
					Note that, since the AND gate is multiplication, $\alpha^n = \alpha\wedge\alpha\wedge\dots\wedge\alpha = \alpha \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, that is, any non-zero exponents can be discarded as long as the value inside is a bounded boolean (i.e. between 0 and 1).
				</p>
				<p>
					The OR gate was way harder. I tried to use $\alpha \vee \beta = \alpha + \beta$ at first, which works, but it came with the problem that $1 \vee 1 = 2$ under this definition, which was nonsensical.
					So, to solve it, at first I came up with the absolutely absurd $\frac{2(\alpha+\beta)}{\alpha+\beta+\alpha\beta+1}$, which technically works, but is extremely complex for a function as simple as OR.
					Finally, I just noticed that we could subtract 1 whenever both outputs were 1 to avoid overflow, i.e. we could set $\alpha \vee \beta = \alpha + \beta - \alpha\beta$.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moving on to the XOR gate, we can apply two types of reasoning to achieve the same formula:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The XOR gate is only 1 whenever the inputs are different, i.e. when $\alpha - \beta \neq 0$.
							Since $\alpha - \beta$ can only be 1 or -1 when $\alpha \neq \beta$, we can define XOR as $\alpha \oplus \beta = (\alpha - \beta)^2$ (it is possible to use the absolute value function instead of squaring, but squaring will lead us to better simplification).
							We can expand this form: $(\alpha - \beta)^2 = \alpha^2 + \beta^2 - 2\alpha\beta = \alpha + \beta - 2\alpha\beta$.
						</li>
						<li>
							We can follow the logic we followed with OR by keeping XOR's truth table in mind, and we can derive that the XOR gate is nothing but OR minus AND, i.e. $\alpha + \beta - \alpha\beta - \alpha\beta = \alpha + \beta - 2\alpha\beta$.
						</li>
					</ul>
					In any case, the formula for XOR is $\alpha \oplus \beta = \alpha + \beta - 2\alpha\beta = (\alpha - \beta)^2$.
					Note that, in the second definition, the square cannot be removed from the parenthesis, as $\alpha - \beta$ is not always a bounded boolean.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, the negated gates NAND, NOR and XNOR can be achieved by applying NOT to these operations.
					<ul>
						$$\begin{aligned}
							\neg(\alpha \wedge \beta) &= 1 - \alpha\beta\\
							\neg(\alpha \vee   \beta) &= 1 - \alpha - \beta + \alpha\beta\\
							\neg(\alpha \oplus \beta) &= 1 - \alpha - \beta + 2\alpha\beta = 1 - (\alpha - \beta)^2
						\end{aligned}$$
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					We can check whether De Morgan's laws apply to these definitions.
					<ul>
						$$\neg(\alpha \wedge \beta) = \neg\alpha \vee \neg\beta \implies 1 - \alpha\beta = 1 - \alpha + 1 - \beta - (1 - \alpha)(1 - \beta) = 2 - \alpha - \beta - (1 - \alpha - \beta + \alpha\beta) = 1 - \alpha\beta$$
						$$\neg(\alpha \vee \beta) = \neg\alpha \wedge \neg\beta \implies 1 - \alpha - \beta + \alpha\beta = (1 - \alpha)(1 - \beta)$$
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					TODO: prove associativity and commutativity (commutativity is due to symmetry)
				</p>
				<h3>Example circuit: Adder</h3>
				<p>
					Now, we could define simple circuits with these definitions. However, it isn't the simplest task, especially due to the $\alpha\beta$ terms in OR and XOR, and all of the alternating subtraction and addition.
					We will try to build an adder which takes in three inputs: $\alpha, \beta$, the bits to sum, and $\gamma$, the carry in; and outputs $o$, the result, and $c$, the carry out.
				</p>
				<p>
					The output is entirely determined by XOR gates: summing 2 bits is as simple as returning 0 if they are both 0, 1 if one of them is 1, and 0 if both are 0 (the output would be 10, which is represented as a 0 in the output and a 1 in the carry out).
					As such, we can simply add the carry in bit to the result of summing the 2 input bits, which can be done likewise.
					The resulting expression is $o = \alpha\oplus\beta\oplus\gamma$.
				</p>
				<p>
					The carry out can be determined by AND and OR gates: the carry out will only be 1 if a pair of bits is on or if all three bits are on, which is already accounted for by the previous condition.
					We can simply take each pair of bits, AND them, and OR the result with that of every other pair of bits.
					The resulting expression is $c = (\alpha\wedge\beta) \vee (\alpha\wedge\gamma) \vee (\beta\wedge\gamma)$.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, we can use our definitions of XOR, AND and OR to express this circuit as a pair of algebraic expressions.
					In this first expansion, note that we are implicitly removing squares from bounded booleans to ease simplification.
					$$\begin{aligned}
						o &= \left((\alpha - \beta)^2 - \gamma\right)^2\\
						&= \left(\alpha + \beta - 2\alpha\beta - \gamma\right)^2\\
						&=\alpha + \alpha\beta - 2\alpha\beta - \alpha\gamma
						 + \alpha\beta + \beta - 2\alpha\beta - \beta\gamma
						 - 2\alpha\beta - 2\alpha\beta + 4\alpha\beta + 2\alpha\beta\gamma
						 - \alpha\gamma - \beta\gamma + 2\alpha\beta\gamma + \gamma\\
						&= \alpha + \beta + \gamma - 2\alpha\beta - 2\alpha\gamma - 2\beta\gamma + 4\alpha\beta\gamma
					\end{aligned}$$
					$$\begin{aligned}
						c &= \alpha\beta \vee \alpha\gamma \vee \beta\gamma\\
						&= (\alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma - 2\alpha\beta\gamma) \vee \beta\gamma\\
						&= \alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma - 2\alpha\beta\gamma + \beta\gamma - (\alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma - 2\alpha\beta\gamma)\beta\gamma\\
						&= \alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma + \beta\gamma - 2\alpha\beta\gamma
					\end{aligned}$$
					Now we have equations for $o$ and $c$ in terms of $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, which is neat.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, we can express any circuit with 3 inputs in the form $k_0 + k_1\alpha + k_2\beta + k_3\gamma + k_4\alpha\beta + k_5\alpha\gamma + k_6\beta\gamma + k_7\alpha\beta\gamma$, which means we only need the set of coefficients $\{k_0,k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4,k_5,k_6,k_7\}$ to uniquely determine a circuit with 3 inputs (where $k_i\in\mathbb{Z}$).
				</p>
				<p>
					Generalizing, we need $2^n$ terms for a circuit with $n$ inputs, which we may denote $\{k_0, k_1, \dots, k_{n-1}\}$, where $k_i\in\mathbb{Z}$.
					However, we could still simplify this by employing a powerful algebraic tool, reducing the possibilities for $k_i$ to merely 0 and 1.
				</p>

				<h2>Modulo 2</h2>
				<p>
					Remember how defining circuits with our earlier definitions was hard due to excess $\alpha\beta$ terms in OR and XOR and alternating subtraction and addition?
					A consequence of working mod 2 is that every number above 1 can be reduced to a number between 0 and 1 by repeatedly subtracting 2 (or taking the remainder of the long division by 2).
					This means that we can greatly simplify many things.
				</p>
				<p>
					Subtraction and addition can be proven to be the same operation.
					If we have the expression $\alpha - \beta$, where both are integers mod 2, $\alpha + \beta = \alpha - \beta \implies \alpha + 2\beta = \alpha$ which will always be true, for $2\beta$ is 0 mod 2. (TODO: more rigorous proof)
				</p>
				<p>
					A side product of subtraction and addition being the same is that we can rewrite $\neg\kappa$ as $1 + \kappa$, and $\alpha\oplus\beta$ as $\alpha + \beta$.
				</p>
				<p>
					The new definitions for operations mod 2 is:
				</p>
				<p>
					This greatly simplifies our adder circuit to $o=\alpha+\beta+\gamma$ and $c=\alpha\beta+\alpha\gamma+\beta\gamma$. Isn't that cool?
				</p>
			</section>

				<h2>8-bit adder</h2>
				<p>
					(TODO)
					Represent 8-bit adder as system of equations where we map 16 inputs to 8 outputs (discard first carry in and last carry out).
					Set desired outputs $o_0,o_1,\dots,o_7$; ANDing the original output functions with desired values.
					Finally, AND all of them together, and the result is one huge equation, and we can prove its satisfiability and its simplification.
